# Hangman

This is a project in which I used PyGame to design a simple version of the game Hangman.

The code for this project is a little messy right now, and I will be cleaning it soon.

I will likely work on another project in the future in which I intend to use sockets to make this a true 2-player game that can be played by two people remotely (using a server).
